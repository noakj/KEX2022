# Software Diversity in the Supply Chain of Ethereum

## Background
- Software Supply Chains:
    - What are they
    - Why are they interesting (security)
- Software Diversity (in terms of dependencies)
- Ethereum:
    - What is it? (Very short summary)
    - Why interesting in terms of Software Supply Chains?
## Problem Statement
- State it and move on
- List research questions
- List clients studied
## Methodology
- Project Pipeline
- Uniform Dependency Tree
- Implementation:
    - Data gathering (dependency trees - show one of each type)
    - Data processing - uniform
    - Data Analysis:
        - Tree analysis
        - Eco System Analysis
        - Manual Analysis
## Results
- RQ1
- RQ2
- RQ3
## Summary
- Software Supply Chains are vulnerable
- Eth2 > Eth1
- Diversity: Go < Java < Rust
- All use Prometheus

## Extra
- Types of software supply chain attacks
- Examples of Ethereum security breaches
