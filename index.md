### INTRO AND BACKGROUND (DEADLINE is April 14th)
- [.] Create a figure with the thesis pipeline and describe it (goes into a methodology section):
    - [X] figure
    - [ ] Justify the motivation
    - [ ] Describe the technical challenges
- [ ] Write a section with the state of the art (10 to 15 papers and summarize the methodology)
    - How many projects are analyzed?
    - What kind of analysis?
    - What is missing?

### RESULTS (DEADLINE is April 21st)

    - [ ] Columns: totals dependencies, direct, transitive, different group ids, redundancy of dependencies,.
- [ ] RQ2: What is the diversity of dependencies in the supply chain of Ethereum clients?
    - [ ] How many dependencies do they have in common, which are the categories of common dependencies, and which are the most common suppliers of monoculture?
- [ ] RQ3: What are the key functionalities in the software supply chain of Go, Java, and Rust Ethereum clients?
    - [ ] Do a qualitative analysis of the categories of dependencies of the different trees
    - [ ] You can use a Venn diagram + description
